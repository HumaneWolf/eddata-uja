A bunch of websites have EDMC plugins to get more journal data and tie it to users and such, a standard interface where the user just copy pastes a url and an access token and everything configures itself would be pretty neat to simplify that

With this idea, if I wanted to add EDSM, I would do the following:
* Copy a url, for example edsm.com/datasubmission.
* Give that to EDMC, EDDiscovery, etc.
* It would load the config from that url, and see how to authenticate and such, then ask me for the needed info
* EDMC can then submit the information to EDSM, without me installing any kind of plugin or changing any file. EVerything is in the UI




Would need:
* Filtering events and journal types.
* Batching (send everything every x seconds/x jumps/session)
* Auth schemas, maybe also have a session key generated when game or client starts?

* Some kind of aggregation?






Other idea:
* Central plugin repository for EDMC, and support those in other clients too.
